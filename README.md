# shipper-challenge

This was a coding test given by Shipped.id to showcase my Front-end skill.
<br />
A mockup was provided but i took some steps beyond it to learn more as i go along.
<br />
<br />
The Sidebar is functional. I have it render empty content.
<br />
Everything apart from the Driver Info Card component is as responsive as i can make of.
<br />
It was done to preserve the consistency of the card's inner layout.
